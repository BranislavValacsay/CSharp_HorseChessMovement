# Chess Knight Move Solver

This project is a C# console application that calculates the minimum number of moves required for a knight to reach a specific target position on a chessboard. The algorithm explores the possible moves of the knight on a square chessboard of customizable size and finds the shortest path from a starting position to a target position.

## About This Project

The program starts from a given position of the knight and uses BFS to explore all valid moves on the board. It keeps track of visited positions to avoid redundant calculations. The goal is to reach the target position with the least number of moves.

## Features

- **Chessboard Movement**: Solves for the minimum number of moves for a knight to reach a target position.
- **Knight Movement Logic**: Simulates the knight's "L" shaped moves on a chessboard.
- **Customizable Board Size**: The board size can be adjusted, making the algorithm flexible for non-standard chessboards.
- **Efficient BFS Approach**: Uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to ensure the shortest path is found.
